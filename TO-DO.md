### Cohesion and Coupling
  * Client-Visitor: The **client** accepts the **visitor** to access a concrete class, and the visitor(class) implements the method to manipulate the concrete class's private data. Usually, the client is **low cohesion** and the visitor is **high coupling (couple or dependent to every concrete class)**.
